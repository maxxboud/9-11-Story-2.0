<h2>Dateline: An account of the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks and the Memorial Service through the lens of New York City Corrections Department </h2>

<p>Two decades later and 9/11 is still a day that leaves many Americans with sorrow, but for the New York City Department of Corrections they are grateful to finally be recognized for being the actual first responders during this American tragedy with their annual memorial service on Rikers Island. <p>
<p>Brenda Pearson is a retired 23-year veteran for the New York City Department of Corrections. <p>
<p> Pearson was a corrections officer who worked for the Emergency Service Unit during the 9/11 Terrorist attacks.<p>
<p>“That was a very chaotic day. It was unbelievable and it was more real when I reported to the site of that location. It was dark and it was desolate.” <p>
<p>The Department of Corrections holds this memorial service on Rikers Island annually to allow their retirees and family members the chance to come back to pay their respects to veterans who lost their life after the attacks.<p> 

<p>This year the New York Department of Corrections also released a book “Bold Responders” that illustrates the stories of these forgotten heroes, and the Department of Corrections made a vow to continue to add to the book during the ceremony. <p>
<p>“It was New York City corrections who established communications for every agency that could use communications. We established lighting in those areas. We had communications up and running. We did a lot of agencies and inter agency training with NYPD and the fire departments, but our hands were in that pile,” said Pearson. <p>
<p>The memorial service was held on a sunny Friday at Rikers Island and after the ceremonial portion of the service was over, it seemed like the Department of Corrections wanted to gather at the tent where food was being served in order to fellowship and recount what happened on that horrific day. <p>
<p>“I actually thought it was an accident and a plane was flying low. A few minutes later I was sitting in my office looking at the smoke and I saw the second plane coming around and it went into the second building. That’s when I knew we were under attack,"" Sharita Edmonds, a retired administrative assistant with the New York City Department of Corrections. <p>
<p>As the day begun to wind down and NYC Department of Corrections alum started saying their goodbyes to one another, it was noticeable that they finally were proud to be receiving their recognition for their contributions from the Commissioner Louis A. Molina as well as fellow Department of Corrections officers. <p>
<p>“I think it’s wonderful because they did a lot. We were first responders; we were there when everything collapsed. Our legacy is that we are the boldest and we do whatever needs to be done,” said Carmen Reyes, retired New York City Department of Corrections officer. <p>
